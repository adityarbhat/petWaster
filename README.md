# petWaster Summary
The Environmental Finance Center (EFC) at the University of Maryland is launching a Pet Waste Education Campaign in collaboration with the Prince George’s County. An outreach program and an educational effort have been designed to increase awareness about the issue of pet waste pollution and to encourage residents to pick up their pet’s waste. 

As a part of this campaign, they have decided to launch a mobile application that will help the residents of PG County in locating the nearest pet waste facility when they are out for a walk with their pets. This mobile application will have an easy to use interface that the residents can use to search and locate the nearest pet waste stations. Along with the other components of this Pet Waste campaign the EFC wants to use the mobile application as an asset management tool to measure the success of the campaign. 
The two major stakeholders of this mobile application are the Residents of PG County who will use this application to locate the nearest pet waste facility and the EFC along with the PG County government that is funding this project.

The risks associated with this project are similar to any mobile application development projects i.e. breakdown of plugins, issues with the platform tools and other compatibility issues.

The final deliverable of this project will be a mobile application that the residents can download from the respective platform app stores. Also a technical documentation outlining the major functionalities of the system will be delivered as a part of the final deliverable
